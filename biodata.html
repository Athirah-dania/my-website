        <big>About Myself</big><small>(AD)</small>
        </p>
        My name is <b><i>Athirah Dania Binti Anuar.</b></i> 
        I am 20 years old. I am the third child of five siblings. 
        I am the eldest daughter in the family and have two brothers. 
        I was born in <b><i>Bentong hospital, Pahang.</i></b> Favourite food is tomyam spaghetti cooked by my mom. 
        My hobby is watching drama or series. 
        Besides that, I also like to <strong>play badminton</strong> in my spare time.
         I have ambitions to work in the IT field. Three words that can describe me are <b><em>quiet, focused and high spirited.</em></b>
         <p><h2> My Pesona</p></h2>
         I instill high expectations in myself so people around me see that as a negative thing,
          but for me that's what drives me to want to move forward. 
         <p><h2>My Goals</h2></p>
        My goals are to be rich and have wonderful life.Be a person parents can be proud of. If I could achieve one goal next year it would be to hold the office of vice chancellor. 
        <p>
        I have just recently completed my industrial training at IPGKPI. 
        Where I gained a new experience. Something that makes me happy is being able to eat delicious food. When I'm sad,
         I often reflect and do things that are happy and stress-free such as watching kdrama and series.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         In addition, I am very interested in watching series and dramas, which I consider to be rich entertainment with different kinds of stories and perspectives. 
         I enjoy series from various genres, whether it's mystery, psychological, or life drama, because it gives me the opportunity to understand complex characters and experience deep storylines.
         Watching the series also takes me into a different world without having to leave the house, and it inspires and entertains me in my free time. 
         Also, I like to try unique food, especially traditional dishes and fusion cuisine, because I believe that food is not only filling, but also an art form that carries its own culture and story. 
       <br>As a student in Information Management, I have big goals for my future. 
         I hope to be able to apply the skills I learned at university in the world of work in the future, 
         especially in the field of data management and more effective information delivery. 
         I aspire to be an individual who makes an impact in this field, whether in the public service industry or the private sector, 
         by contributing to innovation in information management and communication technology.
         Through continuous efforts and learning, I hope to become a visionary and competitive person, capable of bringing positive change to society.
