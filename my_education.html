            <h2> <font color="#3d2fce">In kindergaten school</font></h2>
            <b>while in kindergarten, I was the quietest girl, 
            so the teacher had to train me to get along with other friends.
            But after being at school for so long, I'm comfortable adjusting. 
            The memory of being in kindergarten is the most enjoyable memory of this because,
            the days my father would drop me off and pick me up from kindergarten.</b>

            <h2><font color="#3d2fce">In Elementary school</font></h2>
            <b>In elementary school, I was shy and difficult to get along with.
            But that didn't stop me from continuing to succeed. UPSR results,
            I managed to get 2 A which is an opportunity for me to challenge myself 
            to improve my performance.
            For religious school, I managed to get 7 A's for the upkk exam and mumtaz for psra.</b>

            <h2> <font color="#3d2fce">In Secondary School</font></h2>
            <b>In the world of my high school, is one of the new experiences 
            for me in the world of teenagers. Where, the atmosphere around changes
            and I need to be mature for all things. In the ups and downs of high school
            I met many good friends. The teachers who taught me tirelessly will never be forgotten.
            They are the reason why I have succeeded until now.</b>

            <h2><font color="#3d2fce"> Univeristy Era </font></h2>
            <b>My journey of continuing my studies at the university level has been one filled 
            with challenges and hope. After completing my schooling, 
            I took a significant step by pursuing a diploma in Information Management at UiTM Rembau.
            Although the path hasnâ€™t been easy, especially with the need to adapt to a new environment,
            I see it as an opportunity to expand my knowledge and realize my potential. Along the way,
            Iâ€™ve also come to understand myself better, such as my preference for spending time alone
            while cherishing meaningful connections with trusted friends. With determination and
            support from family and friends, I strive to overcome challenges and achieve my goals.</b>
