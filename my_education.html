            <b>while in kindergarten, I was the quietest girl, 
            so the teacher had to train me to get along with other friends.
            But after being at school for so long, I'm comfortable adjusting. 
            The memory of being in kindergarten is the most enjoyable memory of this because,
            the days my father would drop me off and pick me up from kindergarten.</b>

            But that didn't stop me from continuing to succeed. UPSR results,
            I managed to get 2 A which is an opportunity for me to challenge myself 
            to improve my performance.
            For religious school, I managed to get 7 A's for the upkk exam and mumtaz for psra.</b>

            for me in the world of teenagers. Where, the atmosphere around changes
            and I need to be mature for all things. In the ups and downs of high school
            I met many good friends. The teachers who taught me tirelessly will never be forgotten.

            with challenges and hope. After completing my schooling, 
            I took a significant step by pursuing a diploma in Information Management at UiTM Rembau.
            Although the path hasn‚Äôt been easy, especially with the need to adapt to a new environment,
            I see it as an opportunity to expand my knowledge and realize my potential. Along the way,
            I‚Äôve also come to understand myself better, such as my preference for spending time alone
            while cherishing meaningful connections with trusted friends. With determination and
            support from family and friends, I strive to overcome challenges and achieve my goals.</b>
